# Rustlings

These are my solutions to [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
exercises

## Running Rustlings

Run `rustlings` in the repo to launch the interactive CLI program in watch mode.
It will automatically load the first incomplete exercise and update when an
exercise file is updated

## How the repo was initialised

Per the instructions in the main Rustlings repo at the time of writing, this
repo was initialised using `rustlings init`
